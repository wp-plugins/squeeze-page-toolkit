The official Squeeze Page Toolkit plugin that connects your account for hosting your squeeze pages and landing pages on your WordPress website. 


== Description ==

The Squeeze Page Toolkit is the simplest and easiest way for busy business owners to get smart with their marketing, by creating landing pages that generate leads and get them customers. This official integration for WordPress makes it super-easy to host your squeeze pages on your WordPress website.

The toolkit is specifically designed for business owners who are not particularly technical, but just want to focus on growing their business. The toolkit allows you to create landing pages and squeeze pages that directly create more business, either from building a list of prospects or through creating landing pages with special offers. 

The benefits of the Squeeze Page Toolkit on WordPress:

* Use the existing templates to create pages that *build your business* by allowing customers to *choose to join your database of customers* using lead magnets. 
* Your pages are *loaded from your website*, which helps you to use some advertising networks, such as Google Adwords.
* Your landing pages are *completely independent of your theme*, which means you can change your theme as much as you like without needing to worry about your landing pages going wrong.
* You can benefit from all of the <b>useful statistics</b>, so that you know how well your pages are performing without needing to do any techie stuff. 

To use this WordPress plugin, you'll need a Squeeze Page Toolkit account. You can get a [30-day free trial account](http://www.squeezepagetoolkit.com/trial) or you can [watch a demo](http://www.squeezepagetoolkit.com/demo) to see how the toolkit works.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need a Squeeze Page Toolkit account? =

All of the clever stuff that makes the landing pages work effectively is all done by the Squeeze Page Toolkit. The WordPress plugin allows you to use your landing pages with Google Adwords as they require that your landing page URL matches a real website. 

Packages for the toolkit start at &pound;19+VAT per month, however, you can also test this WordPress plugin (and the toolkit) by using the [30-day free trial account](http://www.squeezepagetoolkit.com/trial).


= When I've connected a Squeeze Page - but I'm getting a 404 message. Help! =

1. Have you updated your permalinks recently? Go to `Permalinks` in WP admin, and click on the `Save Changes` button.
1. If you have any other landing page tools on WordPress, this may interfere with this plugin, so do try disabling them first to see if that resolves the issue.
1. See the reference about [URL compatibility mode](http://support.wpdoctors.co.uk/support/solutions/articles/3000009178) for  the WordPress plugin.  
1. If that doesn't solve the issue, then please contact [Squeeze Page Toolkit support](http://support.wpdoctors.co.uk/support/home) with what you have in `Custom Structure` in the `Permalinks` section in WP admin.

= Can I use a squeeze page for my website landing page? =

Yes! You can select this option by visiting `Squeeze Pages` and then `Settings`.  You can use the `Use page for for your homepage` setting.

= Will the landing pages automatically work on mobiles and tablets? =

Yes! All pages are automatically mobile responsive.
